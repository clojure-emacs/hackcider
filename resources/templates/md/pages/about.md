## Hacking CIDER

This site aims to be a resource for hacking on CIDER. It's not about flashy websites or graphics, but a way to learn how to delve into the CIDER codebase, both elisp and Clojure. Pull requests are encouraged. Pull requests are not just for experts: feel free to contribute "tiny" fixes that clean up the visuals, articles about your own CIDER hacking and prototyping, or core contributors tips and tricks.

The great thing about elisp is that if you're here, you're already familiar with parentheses and evaluation. Understanding and modifying elisp will come second nature. All it takes is an introduction to the codebase, a few tools, and how to write some tests.
